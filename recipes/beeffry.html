            <h1>Beef Fry</h1>
            <div class="intro"><p>Beef fry is a dish made of beef, slow-roasted in a mixture of spices, onions, curry leaves, and coconut slivers, fried in coconut oil. The dish is also popularly known in Kerala as "Beef Ullarthiyathu".</p>
            <p>The dishes origins can be traced back to AD 52, after which Syrian Christians have been known to have settled in Kerala, however the first Jewish settlers arrived in Kerala as early as 6th century BC, and brought with them Kosher cattle slaughter techniques, which could have also led to the development of the recipe.</p>
