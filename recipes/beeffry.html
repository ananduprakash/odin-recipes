    <h2>About Beef Fry</h2>

    <p>The dishes origins can be traced back to AD 52, after which Syrian Christians have been known to have settled in Kerala, however the first Jewish settlers arrived in Kerala as early as 6th century BC, and brought with them Kosher cattle slaughter techniques, which could have also led to the development of the recipe.</p>
