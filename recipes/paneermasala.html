            <h1>Paneer Butter Masala</h1>
            <div class="intro"><p>Paneer butter masala or Paneer makhani,  is next only to Butter chicken when it comes to serving in parties. A favourite with vegetarians, this recipe requires very little effort to cook. No wonder it is one of the most often served Indian recipes.</p>
            <p>A dish with rich creamy gravy, Paneer butter masala recipe is one of the simplest and can be prepared in several ways. My method however is the one that brings it closest to it’s non vegetarian counterpart, the world famous Butter Chicken</p>
